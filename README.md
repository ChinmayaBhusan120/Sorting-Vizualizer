# Sorting-Vizualizer
his project is a Sorting Algorithm Visualizer that allows users to visualize how different sorting algorithms work. The key features of the project include:

Visual RepresentTation: It displays an array of bars where the height of each bar represents a value in the array.
Sorting Algorithms: The visualizer supports multiple sorting algorithms such as:
Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Customization Options:
Array Size: Users can dynamically adjust the size of the array using a slider.
Sorting Speed: A speed control slider allows users to adjust the speed of the sorting visualization.
Stop Button: A stop button allows users to halt the sorting process at any time.
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts to screen sizes, with a clean and styled user interface.
The project demonstrates sorting concepts with an interactive and educational approach, making it easier to understand how sorting algorithms work through animation.
